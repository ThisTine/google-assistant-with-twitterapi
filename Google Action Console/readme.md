# Google Action console side
When yo done with your server you need to add some code to google action console so it can fetch data from your API

## Before getting in to this project
* *Google never going to let you fetch your api unit you enable "Pay AS YOU GO" in Backend services*

* *Add you name of your webhook to match the name that you set in "Main invocation>call your web hook" *
